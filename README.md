<h1>User-Friendly System Call Interface for Enhanced Security - Project Documentation 🛡️💻</h1>

<h2>Introduction 🌟 </h2>

This project aims to design and implement a user-friendly system call interface to enhance security in operating systems. By simplifying the interaction between user applications and the OS kernel, this system introduces authentication mechanisms and logging to prevent unauthorized access to critical resources. The proposed solution is especially valuable in improving system-level security and transparency. 🔐📂

<h1>Problem Statement ❓</h1>

Operating system interfaces for system calls are often complex and lack mechanisms for user authentication and activity logging. This opens up vulnerabilities to unauthorized access and malicious exploitation. There is a need for a secure, intuitive, and trackable system call interface that empowers both users and system administrators. This project addresses these challenges by building a secure interface that authenticates requests and maintains logs for every access. 🛡️📊

<h1>Project Overview 📋</h1>

This project provides an enhanced system call interface built using Python that includes:

Authentication - Verifies user identity before granting access to system-level functions. 🔐

Logging - Maintains an activity log for all system calls made through the interface. 📝

Simplified Access - Wraps common system calls into user-friendly commands. 🖱️

Access Control - Restricts access to sensitive system calls based on user roles. 🚫

<h1>Features ✨</h1>

Secure Login System

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Audit Logs for All System Calls

Custom Interface Commands for File Handling, Process Management, etc.

Extensible Design for Adding More System Calls Easily

<h1>Files in the Repository 📁 </h1>

system_call_interface.py: Python script implementing the secure system call interface.

log.txt: Log file that records all system call activities.

README.md: Project documentation (this file).

users.json: Stores user credentials and roles for authentication.

<h1>Requirements ⚙️ </h1>

Python 3.8 or later 🐍

OS module (built-in) 📂

JSON module (built-in) 📄

<h1>Methodology 🧪 </h1>

System Design: Define system call categories and user roles.

Authentication Module: Develop login system using JSON for storing user data.

Interface Development: Create a CLI for users to call system-level functions.

Logging Implementation: Add logging for all operations using Python’s logging module.

Testing: Validate with various users and role permissions.

<h2>Insights 💡 </h2>

Improved Security: Only authenticated users can perform system-level actions.

Traceability: All actions are logged for auditing and review.

Ease of Use: Interface abstracts complex system calls with user-friendly commands.

<h2>Challenges 🚧 </h2>

Maintaining fine-grained access control for different user roles.

Ensuring real-time logging without performance lags.

Handling concurrent user requests securely.

<h2>Future Work 🚀 </h2>

GUI Integration: Develop a graphical interface for the system call wrapper.

Encryption: Add encryption for user credentials and logs.

Remote Access: Enable secure remote access to system calls.

Command-Line Enhancements: Add autocompletion and help command features.
